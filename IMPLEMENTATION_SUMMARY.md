# AssignMint Assisted Matching System - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Has Been Implemented

### 1. Core Data Models & Types
- **Updated Task interface** with new fields: `status`, `ownerId`, `price`, `deadlineISO`, `reservedBy`, `reservedUntil`, `matching`
- **New ExpertUser interface** with all required fields for scoring
- **New Invite interface** for managing expert invitations
- **Updated TaskStatus** to include: `open`, `reserved`, `claimed`, `submitted`, `completed`

### 2. Scoring Engine (`src/utils/matching/score.ts`)
- **Expert scoring algorithm** with 8 weighted signals
- **Subject fit** (25%): Expert has subject or completed 2+ tasks
- **Price fit** (15%): Within expert's price range
- **Deadline fit** (15%): Can meet task deadline
- **Rating** (15%): Expert rating normalized to 0-1
- **Accept rate** (10%): Invite acceptance ratio
- **Response speed** (10%): Median response time
- **Level match** (5%): Education level compatibility
- **Historical success** (5%): Completed tasks in subject
- **Helper functions**: `clamp01`, `mapLinear`, `rankExperts`, `getEligibleExperts`

### 3. Matching Services
- **InviteService** (`src/services/matching/inviteService.ts`)
  - Find eligible experts by subject
  - Rank experts using scoring algorithm
  - Create and manage invites
  - Handle push notifications (stubbed for now)
  
- **ReservationService** (`src/services/matching/reservationService.ts`)
  - Soft-claim tasks (15-minute reservations)
  - Confirm claims and convert to permanent assignment
  - Auto-release expired reservations
  - Track expert reservation limits (max 3 concurrent)
  
- **TaskCreationTrigger** (`src/services/matching/onTaskCreate.ts`)
  - Automatically trigger matching on new task creation
  - Send initial wave of invites (top 5 experts)
  - Set next wave timer (15 minutes)
  
- **ExpandRingService** (`src/services/matching/expandRing.ts`)
  - Expand invitation pool after initial wave
  - Progressive strategy: 5 → 25 → all eligible experts
  - Update task matching metadata
  
- **DevScheduler** (`src/services/matching/devScheduler.ts`)
  - Development background scheduler
  - Clean up expired reservations every 60s (30s in mock mode)
  - Process ring expansions every 60s (30s in mock mode)

### 4. UI Components
- **SoftClaimButton** (`src/components/matching/SoftClaimButton.tsx`)
  - Allows experts to soft-claim tasks
  - Shows 15-minute countdown
  - Handles loading states and errors
  
- **ConfirmClaimButton** (`src/components/matching/ConfirmClaimButton.tsx`)
  - Confirms soft-claimed tasks
  - Real-time countdown display
  - Auto-hides when reservation expires
  
- **TaskMatchingBanner** (`src/components/matching/TaskMatchingBanner.tsx`)
  - Shows matching status for task owners
  - Displays invite count and next wave timer
  - Manual refresh button in mock mode

### 5. Custom Hook
- **useMatching** (`src/hooks/useMatching.ts`)
  - Provides access to all matching functionality
  - Handles loading states and errors
  - Clean API for components

### 6. Database & Security
- **Firestore Security Rules** (`firestore.rules`)
  - Task owners: full read/write access
  - Experts: read open tasks, write soft-claims/confirmations
  - Invites: experts can read own invites, update status
  
- **Firestore Indexes** (`firestore.indexes.json`)
  - Composite indexes for optimal query performance
  - Covers all matching system queries

### 7. Testing & Development
- **Seed Script** (`scripts/seedMatchingData.ts`)
  - Creates 8 sample experts with varied profiles
  - Creates 3 sample tasks
  - Commands: `npm run seed:matching`, `npm run seed:matching:clear`
  
- **Environment Configuration**
  - Mock mode: shorter intervals, fewer invites, in-app feedback
  - Production mode: standard intervals, push notifications

## 🚀 How to Test

### 1. iOS Simulator is Already Running
The iOS simulator has been successfully launched and is running the AssignMint app.

### 2. Test the Matching System

#### Option A: Use the Seed Script (Recommended)
```bash
# Create test data
npm run seed:matching

# Clear test data when done
npm run seed:matching:clear
```

#### Option B: Manual Testing
1. **Create a Task**: Use the app to create a new task
2. **Check Console**: Watch for matching system logs
3. **Monitor Invites**: Check if experts are invited
4. **Test Soft-Claim**: Use expert account to soft-claim
5. **Confirm Claim**: Confirm within 15 minutes

### 3. What to Look For

#### Console Logs
```
🎯 MOCK MODE: Sent 3 invites for task "Calculus Homework Help"
   Next wave scheduled in 15 minutes
🕐 Released 2 expired reservations
🔄 Processed 1 ring expansions
```

#### App Behavior
- **Task Creation**: Should trigger automatic expert matching
- **Matching Banner**: Shows invite count and next wave timer
- **Expert View**: Should see soft-claim buttons on open tasks
- **Reservation**: 15-minute countdown for soft-claimed tasks

### 4. Mock Mode Features
- **Shorter Intervals**: 30s instead of 60s for faster testing
- **Fewer Invites**: 3 instead of 5 initial invites
- **Manual Refresh**: Button to manually trigger matching
- **Visual Feedback**: Console logs for all operations

### Key Algorithms
1. **Expert Scoring**: Weighted combination of 8 signals
2. **Progressive Invitation**: 5 → 25 → all experts
3. **Reservation Management**: 15-minute soft-claim windows
4. **Auto-Expansion**: Automatic ring expansion every 15 minutes

### Security Features
- **Owner Verification**: Only task owners can modify tasks
- **Expert Validation**: Experts can only claim tasks they're invited to
- **Reservation Limits**: Max 3 concurrent reservations per expert
- **Time Validation**: Reservations auto-expire after 15 minutes

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate Testing
1. **Verify iOS Simulator**: App should be running without errors
2. **Seed Test Data**: Run `npm run seed:matching`
3. **Test Flow**: Create task → check invites → soft-claim → confirm
4. **Monitor Logs**: Watch console for matching system activity

### Production Deployment
1. **Deploy Indexes**: `firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes`
2. **Deploy Rules**: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`
3. **Cloud Functions**: Migrate scheduler to Cloud Functions cron jobs
4. **Push Notifications**: Integrate with production push service

### Future Enhancements
1. **AI-Powered Matching**: Machine learning for better compatibility
2. **Dynamic Pricing**: Adjust prices based on demand
3. **Expert Availability**: Real-time availability tracking
4. **Performance Optimization**: Caching and query optimization

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **TypeScript Errors**: Run `npm run typecheck` to verify
2. **Firestore Errors**: Check security rules and indexes
3. **No Experts Found**: Verify expert data structure
4. **Matching Not Triggering**: Check task status and creation flow

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check TypeScript
npm run typecheck

# Test matching system
npm run test:matching

# Seed test data
npm run seed:matching

# Clear test data
npm run seed:matching:clear
```
