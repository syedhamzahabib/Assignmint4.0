# GitHub Push & Restore Guide

This guide explains how to safely push AssignMint to GitHub and restore it after cloning.

## üöÄ For You (Hamza) - Pushing to GitHub

### Quick Start (Automated)

Simply run the automated script:

```bash
./scripts/push-to-github.sh
```

The script will:
1. ‚úÖ Check and update .gitignore
2. ‚úÖ Remove large files from Git tracking (Pods, boost files)
3. ‚úÖ Check for any remaining large files
4. ‚úÖ Create/switch to a branch
5. ‚úÖ Stage and commit all changes
6. ‚úÖ Push to GitHub

### What Gets Excluded (Automatically)

These files are in `.gitignore` and won't be pushed:
- `ios/Pods/` - iOS dependencies (200-500 MB)
- `ios/build/` - iOS build artifacts
- `android/build/` - Android build artifacts
- `boost_*.tar.bz2` - Large boost library files
- `node_modules/` - npm packages
- `.env` files - Environment variables
- `google-services.json` - Firebase config (sensitive)

### What Gets Included (Important!)

These files WILL be pushed (your friend needs them):
- ‚úÖ All `.md` documentation files
- ‚úÖ `ios/Podfile` and `ios/Podfile.lock` - To restore Pods
- ‚úÖ `package.json` and `package-lock.json` - To restore npm packages
- ‚úÖ All source code (`src/`, `components/`, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Configuration files
- ‚úÖ Native project files (but not build artifacts)

## üì• For Your Friend - After Cloning

### Quick Start (Automated)

After cloning the repo, run:

```bash
./scripts/restore-after-clone.sh
```

The script will:
1. ‚úÖ Check Node.js version
2. ‚úÖ Install npm dependencies
3. ‚úÖ Install iOS Pods (macOS only)
4. ‚úÖ Check Android SDK setup
5. ‚úÖ Verify required files
6. ‚úÖ Provide next steps

### Manual Steps (If Script Doesn't Work)

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd Assignmint3

# 2. Install JavaScript dependencies
npm install

# 3. (macOS only) Restore iOS Pods
cd ios
pod install
cd ..

# 4. Download google-services.json
# Get this from Firebase Console and place at:
# android/app/google-services.json

# 5. Run on Android
npx react-native run-android
```

## üîÑ How It Works

### The Problem
Some files are too large for GitHub:
- `ios/Pods/` folder (200-500 MB)
- `boost_*.tar.bz2` files (100+ MB each)
- Build artifacts

### The Solution
1. **Exclude** large files using `.gitignore`
2. **Keep** the "recipe" files (`Podfile.lock`, `package.json`)
3. **Regenerate** large files after cloning using the recipes

### Why It's Safe
- `Podfile.lock` contains exact versions of iOS dependencies
- `package-lock.json` contains exact versions of npm packages
- Running `pod install` recreates `ios/Pods/` identically
- Running `npm install` recreates `node_modules/` identically

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Manual Process (Advanced)

If you prefer to do it manually instead of using the script:

### Step 1: Update .gitignore

Already done! But if you need to verify:

```bash
cat .gitignore | grep -E "Pods|boost|build"
```

Should show:
```
ios/Pods/
ios/build/
android/build/
boost_*.tar.bz2
```

### Step 2: Remove Large Files from Git Tracking

```bash
# Remove Pods if tracked
git rm -r --cached ios/Pods/ 2>/dev/null || echo "Pods not tracked"

# Remove boost files if tracked
git rm --cached boost_*.tar.bz2 2>/dev/null || echo "No boost files tracked"

# Remove build files if tracked
git rm -r --cached android/build/ 2>/dev/null || echo "Build not tracked"
```

### Step 3: Check for Large Files

```bash
find . -type f -size +50M \
  -not -path "./node_modules/*" \
  -not -path "./ios/Pods/*" \
  -not -path "./.git/*"
```

Should return empty (no large files).

### Step 4: Create Branch and Commit

```bash
# Create new branch
git checkout -b dev/android-onboarding

# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Add onboarding documentation and Android setup"

# Push
git push -u origin dev/android-onboarding
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### "Files too large to push"

**Problem**: Git rejects push due to large files

**Solution**:
```bash
# Find what's being tracked
git ls-files | xargs ls -lh | sort -k5 -hr | head -20

# Remove large files from tracking
git rm --cached <large-file>

# Commit the removal
git commit -m "Remove large files from tracking"
```

### "Pods folder is missing after clone"

**Problem**: No `ios/Pods/` folder after cloning

**Solution**: This is normal! Restore it:
```bash
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
```

### "Can't install Pods"

**Problem**: `pod install` fails

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Update CocoaPods
sudo gem install cocoapods

# Clean and retry
cd ios
rm -rf Pods Podfile.lock
pod install --repo-update
cd ..
```

### "Android build fails after clone"

**Problem**: Android won't build

**Solutions**:
```bash
# 1. Ensure google-services.json is present
ls -la android/app/google-services.json

# 2. Clean Android build
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..

# 3. Reinstall and rebuild
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
npx react-native run-android
```

## üìã Checklist Before Pushing

Before running `./scripts/push-to-github.sh`, verify:

- [ ] All documentation is up to date
- [ ] No sensitive data in code (API keys, passwords)
- [ ] `.gitignore` includes large files
- [ ] Code works on Android (tested)
- [ ] Commit message is clear and descriptive

## üìã Checklist After Cloning

After running `./scripts/restore-after-clone.sh`, verify:

- [ ] `node_modules/` folder exists (npm install worked)
- [ ] `ios/Pods/` folder exists (pod install worked) - macOS only
- [ ] `google-services.json` is in `android/app/`
- [ ] Android app builds and runs
- [ ] Read `DEVELOPER_ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md`

## üéØ Quick Reference

### Push to GitHub (Hamza)
```bash
./scripts/push-to-github.sh
```

### Setup After Clone (Friend)
```bash
./scripts/restore-after-clone.sh
```

### Restore Pods Manually
```bash
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

### Restore npm Packages Manually
```bash
npm install
```

### Check What's Being Tracked
```bash
git ls-files | grep -E "Pods|boost|build"
# Should return nothing
```

## üìû Need Help?

If the scripts don't work:

1. **Check the error message** - Usually tells you what's wrong
2. **Try manual steps** - See "Manual Process" section above
3. **Ask team lead** - Hamza can help with iOS/Git issues
4. **Check Git status** - `git status` shows what's happening

## üîê Security Notes

**Never push these to GitHub:**
- `google-services.json` (Firebase config)
- `GoogleService-Info.plist` (Firebase config)
- `.env` files (API keys)
- `*.keystore` files (signing keys)
- Any passwords or tokens

**Safe to push:**
- Documentation (`.md` files)
- Source code
- Configuration templates
- Lock files (`Podfile.lock`, `package-lock.json`)
