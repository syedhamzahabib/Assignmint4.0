## API Design

### RESTful Endpoints
All API endpoints follow RESTful design principles:

```
GET    /api/v1/resources          # List resources
GET    /api/v1/resources/:id      # Get specific resource
POST   /api/v1/resources          # Create resource
PUT    /api/v1/resources/:id      # Update resource
DELETE /api/v1/resources/:id      # Delete resource
```

### Authentication
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- API key authentication for services
- Rate limiting per user/IP

### Request/Response Format
```typescript
// Request
{
  "data": { ... },
  "metadata": { ... }
}

// Response
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { ... },
  "message": "Operation successful",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

### Error Handling
Standardized error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes:

```typescript
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Error description",
  "code": "ERROR_CODE",
  "details": { ... },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
