**That's it!** The script will:

3. ✅ Create a new branch (you can name it)
4. ✅ Commit all changes
5. ✅ Push to GitHub

### Option 2: Quick Manual

```bash
# Remove large files from tracking (if any)
git rm -r --cached ios/Pods/ 2>/dev/null || true
git rm --cached boost_*.tar.bz2 2>/dev/null || true

# Create and switch to new branch
git checkout -b dev/android-onboarding

# Stage and commit everything
git add .
git commit -m "Add complete onboarding documentation and Android setup

- Add DEVELOPER_ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md with comprehensive instructions
- Update .gitignore to exclude large files
- Add automated push and restore scripts
- Ready for Android developer collaboration"

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin dev/android-onboarding
```

## 📥 What Your Friend Does After Cloning

### Super Simple (Automated)

```bash
# 1. Clone your repo
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd Assignmint3

# 2. Run the restore script
./scripts/restore-after-clone.sh

# 3. Download google-services.json from Firebase
# Place at: android/app/google-services.json

# 4. Run Android app
npx react-native run-android
```

### Manual (If Script Doesn't Work)

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd Assignmint3
npm install
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
npx react-native run-android
```

## 🔄 How Pods Get Restored

**The Magic:**
- `ios/Podfile.lock` is pushed to GitHub (it's tiny)
- This file contains exact versions of all iOS dependencies
- Running `pod install` reads `Podfile.lock` and recreates `ios/Pods/`
- Result: Identical `Pods` folder, no large files in Git!

**Same for npm:**
- `package-lock.json` is pushed to GitHub
- `npm install` reads it and recreates `node_modules/`

---

## ✅ Verified Safe

I checked your project:
- ✅ No large files (>50MB) found
- ✅ `.gitignore` properly configured
- ✅ `Podfile.lock` exists (can restore Pods)
- ✅ `package-lock.json` exists (can restore npm)
- ✅ All documentation files ready
- ✅ Scripts are executable

## 📋 Quick Checklist

Before pushing:
- [ ] Run `./scripts/push-to-github.sh`
- [ ] Let it create a branch (don't push to main)
- [ ] Go to GitHub and create a Pull Request
- [ ] Review the PR to make sure no large files
- [ ] Merge the PR

After your friend clones:
- [ ] They run `./scripts/restore-after-clone.sh`
- [ ] They download `google-services.json`
- [ ] They read `DEVELOPER_ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md`
- [ ] They test on Android: `npx react-native run-android`
